👋 I'm Aidan from Oakland California :) I've been enjoying my years at university, learning and growing. 👋

I started to work in the computer science area eight years ago in highschool. I started making my very first game. I later started studying Technology Information Managment and Computer Engineering at the University of California Santa Cruz. I did an an internship working on cyber security (Kiversal in Spain). I enjoy experiment with different fields of computer science, I like to do and learn a lot of different things.

I am excited to see where the future takes me!
